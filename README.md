## Inspiration
**To gamify D2L and learning to encourage better grades**

## What it does
Our app is a **Chrome Extension** which communicates with the D2L API to display all your courses, which you are passing (or which you are not passing) in an understandable speedy way to so students do not have to go through menu after menu in D2L's cluttered UI. It also displays assignments already completed for those who are busy and forget where in school, and the 4 next assignments for every class; all while gamifying the experience by upgrading your character over the semester with its final form being relative to what you received as a total percentage across all courses

## How we built it
We built it using **JavaScript, HTML and CSS** using the HTML and CSS to handle the front end of the chrome extension and JavaScript to handle all the API calls and backend

## Challenges we ran into
We initially attempted to authenticate with keys to build a website, however security, copyright protection and the inability to retrieve API tokens from a browser without an admin token from D2L. Diesel provided a solution which leads us to our next topic

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are very proud of being able to uphold a secure application in the form of a chrome extension, while also being able to call the API and list current classes and be able to list upcoming and completed assignments

## What we learned
One of the biggest learning points today was building a Chrome extension and utilizing the D2L API which created a near seamless integration with our extension

## What's next for MRU Hacks Project
This project will become a few members daily driver when it comes to productivity.
